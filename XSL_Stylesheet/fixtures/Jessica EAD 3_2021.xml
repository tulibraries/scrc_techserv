    <head>Content Description</head>
<p>Harold Pinnon's memoir recounts the events surrounding the death of Pinnon family patriarch Frank in March 1905 and his wife, unnamed in the memoir, shortly thereafter in April 1905. The author, the oldest child of the Pinnon family, describes where each of his five siblings were placed after the death of their parents, as well as the difficulties of living with his uncle trying to support himself at the age of 13. Harold also recounts when each of the younger children were released from their respective foster homes and subsequently details the relationships of his sisters' marriages and the family's living situation after they were reunited.</p>  </scopecontent>
